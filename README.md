# AfriBrit Cuisines

The AfriBrit restaurant was created as a multi-cultural restaurant, with responsivity and user engagement in mind.
I hoped, while building this site that it would be the last stop for anyone who is searching for a place to get good and quality food. More like home away from home.

## Design



### Topography

Google Fonts was used in the following ways:

* Lato was used for all headers.
* sans-serif solely for the body of the site.

### Imagery
 
 All images used in this site were from various sources, either from Google images or Pexels.com. This will be attributed in the credits section.

 ## Features

The website consists of three(3) pages all of which are accessible via the navigation bar.

* Common features of all pages:

The navigation bar -

![navigation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111319158/192885818-54c8e12c-594d-4f8d-99cb-f7d5c1355afc.PNG)

The responsive navigation bar contains the Home, Cuisines and Reserve Table pages. On the left is the cuisines logo. The navigation bar 
helps the user to access the various pages.

The Footer -

![footer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111319158/192887496-1dfecea3-7885-463e-b7be-c191323e78ed.PNG)

This section contains the address of the restaurant, the office number as well as opening and closing hours. It also
social media links where users can visit to get reviews.

### Features of each pages in detail:

The Home page -

* Navigation and Footer section: This has been explained earlier under common features of all pages.

* AfriBrit Section: This section contains some dishes to give users an idea of what the website
 is about. Using media query, on large screens the images are laid out horizontally, however on mobile devices the images are stacked vertically(on top each other).
 
 The Cuisines page -
 
 This section contains the menu and prices of each cuisine. Easy for users to make a choice and see the prices at a glance.
 
 The Reserve Table page -
 
 This section contains a form where users can put their details to enable them book a table for present or future visits.
 
 ### Accessibility
 
 I tried while building the website to make it as accessible as possible. This was achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no texts.
* Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as active.

## Testing

Chrome developer tools was used for testing at every stage of building the site. 
The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:




The images on the home page was not in alignment with the rest of the page. Padding has now been added to bring it in alignment with the rest of the pages padding.
There was an issue on smaller devices where the book columns were not displaying properly. This issue is documented under issue 2 in solved bugs.
The introduction paragraph on the books page was not aligned in style with the rest of the page. The text has now been centered.
The form could be submitted with only a name filled in. ~ A required attribute has been added to the email input and textarea.
