# AfriBrit Cuisines

The AfriBrit restaurant was created as a multi-cultural restaurant, with responsivity and user engagement in mind.
I hoped, while building this site that it would be the last stop for anyone who is searching for a place to get good and quality food. More like home away from home.

Two main colors were used on the website. The main color being #F50031 which was used for the header and footer for the purpose of getting user's attention. The second color #E6EFEC was as for the overall color of the body. The color palette was created 
using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website

### Topography

Google Fonts was used in the following ways:

* Lato was used for all headers.
* sans-serif solely for the body of the site.

### Imagery
 
 All images used in this site were from various sources, either from Google images or Pexels.com. This will be attributed in the credits section.

 ## Features

The website consists of three(3) pages all of which are accessible via the navigation bar.

* Common features of all pages:

The navigation bar -

 ### Accessibility
 
 I tried while building the website to make it as accessible as possible. This was achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no texts.
* Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as active.

Github Pages was used to deploy the live website. The instructions to achieve this are below:

1. Log in (or sign up) to Github.
1. Find the repository for this project, Bully-Book-Club.
1. Click on the Settings link.
1. Click on the Pages link in the left hand side navigation bar.

## Testing

Chrome developer tools was used for testing at every stage of building the site. 
The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:
 * The width of the hero-image was small than the actual viewport - status: resolved
 * The form content was overflowing from the main container - status: resolved
* The images on the home page was not in alignment with the rest of the page. Padding has now been added to bring it in alignment with     the rest of the pages padding.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML and CSS for all pages.
Test for Index.html
* One(1) error was returened when passed through the official W3C validator. This was unresolved as I did not see the need for 
  a heading tag and the line already had a div tag.
